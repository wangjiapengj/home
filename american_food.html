				<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheeseburger#:~:text=The%20hamburger%20remains%20as%20one,at%20the%20age%20of%2016.">cheeseburger</a> is probably one of the most well known foods in the world. You can find it anywhere, your schools lunch line, a grocery store, a restaurant, everyone knows what it is. The invention of a cheeseburger was actually a mistake, when a chef in the early 1920&rsquo;s tried to cover up a burn mark on a burger with a slice of cheese. Nowadays, a cheeseburger usually consists of 1 or 2 slabs of meat, some lettuce, a few tomatoes, and the signature cheese. In modern day there are many different twists to the cheeseburger but overall it is a classic in American food.</p>
				<h3 class="subjects">Barbecue Ribs (Dinner)</h3>

				<p>Barbecue ribs are pork or beef, slathered or smoked. These ribs are a staple at cookouts across America, and if you've ever been to one this is usually the main dish. The tangy sauce along with the juicy meat and good amount of fat makes it a delicious meal.</p>
