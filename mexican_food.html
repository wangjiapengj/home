				<p>Enchiladas have a very long history. They date back to Mayan times where people in the Valley of Mexico would eat corn tortillas wrapped around small fish. Modern enchiladas use both corn and flour tortillas, and have many different kinds of filling, such as meat, cheese, seafood, beans, and vegetables. Usually, the enchiladas are then covered with chilli sauce to make a delicious breakfast.</p>

				<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco">Tacos</a> once again, like pizza and burgers, are some of the most well known foods in the world. You could say these 3 are the famous fast foods. Tacos are popular because of their simplicity and delicious taste from the combination of vegetables, meat, and cheese topped with many different sauces. You can even eat tacos on a diet by modifying the fillings to more healthy replacements, yet still having the delicious taste. The main bread of a taco is usually a toasted tortilla that has been shaped to stay in place.</p>
